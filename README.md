# Numeracy

This code repository chronicles my attempts to implement the concepts in "Object-Oriented Implementations of Numerical Methods" in a functional style in Elixir.  I do this as my attempt to learn Elixir and brush up on numerical methods.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `numeracy` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:numeracy, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `numeracy` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:numeracy]]
    end
    ```
